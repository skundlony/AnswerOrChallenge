# Quiz Game with Spinner Animation

A simple and fun quiz game built in React, featuring a spinner animation to randomly select questions. Players can choose between "Hard" and "Easy" questions, and if they skip a question, they must complete a "Challenge". The game ensures no repeated questions or challenges within the same game session.

## Features

- Choose between **Hard (Trudne)** or **Easy (Lekkie)** questions.
- If a question is skipped, a random **Challenge (Wyzwanie)** is assigned.
- Spinner animation displays before revealing the selected question or challenge.
- Ensures no repeated questions or challenges in a single game.
- Tracks player score based on question difficulty and challenge completion.
